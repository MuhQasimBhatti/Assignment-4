//Q5: Write a program that reads 10 integers from user. Your program should display the maximum
//, minimum and average of the entered numbers.  Do this program by using array as well as without array?  

#include<iostream>

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		if (max < arr[i])
			max = arr[i];

	cout << "The greatest number is " << max << endl;

	int min = arr[0];

	for (int i = 0; i < 10 ; i++)

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		 sum = sum + arr[i];
	avg = sum / 10;
